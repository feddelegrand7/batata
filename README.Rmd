# batata <a><img src='man/figures/hex.png' align="right" height="200" /></a>

The goal of batata is to help R users manage R packages removals. For example, imagine you're attending tomorrow an R meet up in which you'll experiment many packages that you don't want to keep. By the end of the meet up, you'll have to remember each installed package, its name (trust me, packages' names may be complicated). Further, each installed package might come with a bunch of dependencies which makes the operations more complicated. Using the batata package, you can just run `rm_today_packages()` (one of many other functions), and you're clean for today. Before removing the packages, batata will prompt you to confirm your decision (which adds a certain degree of security), you can also run `today_packages()` to check all the today installed packages before making a decision.

### You might need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) in order to use the package

## Installation

You can install the development version of batata from Github

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/batata")


```

-------------------------------

### `fresh_start()`

The `fresh_start()` function removes all your installed R packages. Particularly useful when moving from an R version to another. This function is quite dangerous, so you'll be prompted twice to make sure that you're absolutely certain to run it. 

----------------------------------

### `today_packages()` and `rm_today_packages()`

`today_packages()` displays all the packages installed the day you're running that function and in parallel, `rm_today_packages()` removes the corresponding packages.  

----------------------------------

### `yesterday_packages()` and `rm_yesterday_packages()` 


`yesterday_packages()` displays all the packages installed the day before you're running that function and in parallel, `rm_yesterday_packages()` removes the corresponding packages.  


-------------------------------------

### `since_packages()` and `rm_since_packages()`

`since_packages()` displays the packages that you've installed according to a specific date. It has two argument: 

+ _date_: the considered date in _yyyy-mm-dd_ format ; 
+ _position_: whether to display the installed packages __at__ that date, __before__ that date or __after__ that date. 

`rm_since_package()` works similarly except that it removes the packages instead of displaying them. 


------------------------------------------


### `latest_packages()` and `rm_latest_packages()` 


Suppose you want to check out the last 10 packages that you've installed, or, maybe you want to display the last installed package: 


```{r}

library(batata)

# The 10 last installed packages

latest_packages(n = 10)


# The last package installed 

latest_packages(n = 1)



```
