The goal of `batata` is to help R users manage R packages removals and installations. 

## Installation

You can install the `batata` package from CRAN with: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("batata")

```
Install the development version of `batata` from Github with: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes") # if not installed

remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/batata")


```

# Packages Removals

For example, imagine you're attending tomorrow an R meet up in which you'll experiment many packages that you don't want to keep. By the end of the meet up, you'll have to remember each installed package, its name (trust me, packages' names may be complicated). Further, each installed package might come with a bunch of dependencies which makes the operations more complicated. Using the batata package, you can just run `rm_today_packages()` (one of many other functions), and you're clean for today. Before removing the packages, batata will prompt you to confirm your decision (which adds a certain degree of security), you can also run `today_packages()` to check all the today installed packages before making a decision. 

`batata` takes into account the __modification time__ of the packages instead of the __birth time__. As such, if you decide to update a package to a newer version, `batata` will consider it as a new package (which is technically true as a new package will be installed). 


-------------------------------

### `fresh_start()`

The `fresh_start()` function removes all your installed R packages. Particularly useful when moving from an R version to another. This function is quite dangerous, so you'll be prompted twice to make sure that you're absolutely certain to run it. 

----------------------------------

### `today_packages()` and `rm_today_packages()`

`today_packages()` displays all the packages installed the day you're running that function and in parallel, `rm_today_packages()` removes the corresponding packages.  

----------------------------------

### `yesterday_packages()` and `rm_yesterday_packages()` 


`yesterday_packages()` displays all the packages installed the day before you're running that function and in parallel, `rm_yesterday_packages()` removes the corresponding packages.  


-------------------------------------

### `since_packages()` and `rm_since_packages()`

`since_packages()` displays the packages that you've installed according to a specific date. It has two argument: 

+ _date_: the considered date in _yyyy-mm-dd_ format ; 
+ _position_: whether to display the installed packages __at__ that date, __before__ that date or __after__ that date. 

`rm_since_package()` works similarly except that it removes the packages instead of displaying them. 


------------------------------------------


### `latest_packages()` and `rm_latest_packages()` 


Suppose you want to check out the last 10 packages that you've installed, or, maybe you want to display the last installed package: 


```{r}

library(batata)

# The 10 last installed packages

latest_packages(n = 10)


# The last package installed (by default = 1)

latest_packages()


```


# Packages Installations

### `install_starred_cran()`

You can install the latest R packages that you've starred on Github using the `install_starred_cran()` function. As an example, the following code chunk will look at the last 10 repositories that I've starred, filter R packages from non-R repos and install them. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install_starred_cran(github_user = 'feddelegrand7', 
                     n = 10)
```

Note that if the starred repo is not available on CRAN, `install_starred_cran()` will simply ignore it. 


### `install_starred_github()`

`install_starred_github()` behaves the same way as `install_starred_cran()` except that it will install the repositories from Github (not from CRAN), so that you can install packages that are not available on CRAN. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

install_starred_github(github_user = 'feddelegrand7', 
                       n = 5, 
                       upgrade = "never")
```

The above code chunk will look for the last five repositories that I've starred, filter out non-R repos and install them. 



### `install_most_starred()`

`install_starred_github()` allows you the install the most starred CRAN packages that are available on Github. It takes one argument `n` that specifies the number of the most starred R packages that you want to install. For example: 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_most_starred(n = 10)
```

The above chunk will look for the 10 most starred R repositories and it will install them if available on CRAN. Of course, it'll ignore R repositories that are not packages, e.g  [R4DS](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) repo.



## Aknowledgement 

Concerning the __packages installation__ part of `batata` I was mainly inspired by the tweet of [Tim Tiefenbach](https://twitter.com/TimTeaFan/status/1352007510425817089), so a big thanks to him !
