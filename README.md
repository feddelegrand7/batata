`batata` is A Toolbox for Managing R Packages Installation and Removal.

## Installation

You can install the `batata` package from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("batata")
```
You can install the development version from Github with: 

``` r
library(remotes) # if available 
install_github('feddelegrand7/batata')
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available [here](https://batata-doc.netlify.app/)

## Aknowledgement

Concerning the **packages installation** part of `batata` I was mainly
inspired by the tweet of [Tim
Tiefenbach](https://twitter.com/TimTeaFan/status/1352007510425817089),
so a big thanks to him !
